HOUSING WORKFLOW

1C.1 Housing (Temporary & Long-Term)
Automation Targets:
- Use housing search engines and/or partner APIs to generate a standardized option list.
- Auto-generate comparison tables with consistent fields: commute, price, type, parking, terms, availability, neighborhood.
- Apply policy and budget guardrails: Filter out options above budget unless flagged as potential exception.
- Approval workflows: Employee selects from options within budget; Employer approves if required.
- Booking layer: Book in employee's name but charge against employer/draw-down account.
- For long-term rentals, expose structured tasks: "Schedule tours", "Review lease", "Confirm final address for HHG".
